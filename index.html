					<p>I&#8217;ve written about my very limited exploits in exploring and leveraging 2010 census data in the past but this weekend I finally got back around to doing something about it. What I ended up with is looking like a pretty useful tool for anyone looking at projecting census data onto arbitrary geometries.</p>
<p><strong>A quick recap</strong><br />
For those who didn&#8217;t read the first <a href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/23/2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done/" title="2010 Census: Leveraging what’s already been done" target="_blank">couple</a> <a href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/24/2010-census-getting-setup/" title="2010 Census: Getting setup" target="_blank">posts</a> I wrote about the reasoning behind why I&#8217;m going through all this trouble in the first place, here&#8217;s the story so far: </p>
<p>I work for the <a href="http://www.bahai.us" title="Baha'i Faith" target="_blank">Bahá&#8217;í Faith</a>. The administration of Bahá&#8217;í communities across the continental United States is broken down into what we call Bahá&#8217;í Localities. These can sometimes be mapped one-to-one onto an existing geography, such as a municipal boundary or a county but often times are combinations or subdivisions of those areas. Which makes the task of projecting census data onto them somewhat tricky. After I wrote about getting the census.ire.org Django project setup on my local VM, I got a Twitter shout out from <a href="http://blog.germuska.com" title="Joe Germuska" target="_blank">Joe Germuska</a> over at the <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" title="Chicago Tribune News Apps Blog" target="_blank">Chicago Tribune</a> suggesting that I take a look at trying to build my shapes out of the basic kernel of all census shapes: the block. So, in case the title of this post doesn&#8217;t give that away, that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><strong>Re-purposing guts of the IRE app</strong><br />
Once I got the <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census" title="IRE census project on Github" target="_blank">census.ire.org project</a> setup I kinda sat back at said to myself, &#8220;uh, OK, now what&#8230;&#8221;. My first approach was actually to forget about all the juicy goodness in there and try to just get what I needed from the API that they offer. Problem is, block level data is not available through the API (which I suppose is understandable given that there are like, 8,000,000 of them).  </p>
<p>Since no one else had the data, it was starting to look like I would have to build it myself (*gulp*). In reading the docs for the IRE Django app, the parts that intrigued me the most were the parts that actually fetched census data and loaded it someplace. The someplace, in their case, was a MongoDB database which, at the end of the day, got dumped out and turned into flat JSONP files which were then uploaded to an S3 bucket so that schmoes like me could access it through the API. Problem with that, at least for me, was that I needed some way of comparing my arbitrary shapes with the census block shapes. What I needed, in a nutshell, was a PostGIS database. Luck for me, <a href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/29/mapping-tools-101-a-few-things-ive-picked-up/" title="Mapping tools 101: A few things I’ve picked up" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve done that before</a>. </p>
<p>So, what it came down to for me was to basically take what they were doing, rip out the MongoDB parts, put in PostgreSQL parts, and run some spatial lookups. Easy, right? Well, yeah but really, really boring.</p>
<p><strong>Before the boring part, the code</strong><br />
OK, now we&#8217;ll get into the meaty part where I show you what I did. My basic approach, like the IRE app, was to write a series of scripts which actually executed the various steps in the process. The real brains of what&#8217;s going on is directly cribbed from the IRE app so I&#8217;d literally be nowhere without them. If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what they did before going any further, the hub round which everything else revolves is called batch_sf.sh and lives <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/tree/master/dataprocessing" title="IRE Census app on Github" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The basic steps I came up with were slightly different than the ones that IRE uses because of a few things: all I wanted was block level data, I needed to know what area on the surface of the Earth the census data related to, and because I didn&#8217;t need to get all the census tables (I cherry picked 14 that seemed to be what I was after). Those steps, in order are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the block level geospatial data into a PostGIS database</li>
<li>Fetch the census data, generate the table headers and save it as CSV</li>
<li>Create a cross reference table that will allow us to relate GIS data to census data</li>
<li>Load the block level census data into already prepared Django models for the 14 tables that I wanted</li>
<li>Finally, make the spatial relations between my arbitrary geographies and census blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of caution before doing any of this stuff: working with block level data takes a huge amount of patience. When I got my batch script working, I ran it against Connecticut and it took 7 hours to complete. And that&#8217;s one of the small states with only 67,000+ census blocks. Illinois has something like 450,000+ census blocks so the scale here gets pretty astronomical pretty fast. When I get the final wrinkles ironed out, the next phase will probably involve setting this stuff up on a cloud server, just letting it crank and then coming up with a way of serializing the output into something that I can use without ever having to run this stuff again until the 2020 census.</p>
<p><strong>Load GIS data</strong><br />
This was actually remarkably simple thanks to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/layermapping/" title="GeoDjango LayerMapping" target="_blank">GeoDjango LayerMapping tool</a>. All it took was getting the data from <a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/TABBLOCK/2010/" title="Block level GIS data" target="_blank">here</a> and stuff it into a Django model. Here&#8217;s the model I went with:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
class CensusBlock(models.Model):
    locality = models.ForeignKey(Locality, null=True)
    xref = models.ForeignKey(XRef, null=True)
    state_fips = models.CharField(max_length=2)
    county_fips = models.CharField(max_length=3)
    tract_code = models.CharField(max_length=6)
    block_number = models.CharField(max_length=4)
    geo_id = models.CharField(max_length=15)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    feat_code = models.CharField(max_length=5)
    land_area = models.IntegerField()
    water_area = models.IntegerField()
    internal_lat = models.CharField(max_length=11)
    internal_lon = models.CharField(max_length=12)
    mpoly = models.MultiPolygonField('Block area', srid=4326)
    objects = models.GeoManager()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return u'%s, (%s)' % (self.name, self.geo_id)
</pre>
<p>The <code>locality</code> field is a <code>ForeignKey</code> to the model where I store the Bahá&#8217;í localities (my arbitrary geographies). The <code>xref</code> field is a ForeignKey to a cross reference table that, at least while it&#8217;s loading, gives us the ability to relate a place on the surface of the earth to the number of people that live there. Other than that, it&#8217;s pretty much a one-to-one mapping of the GIS data that you get from the Census Bureau. Here&#8217;s my LayerMapping script:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#!/bin/env python

# All this stuff is just the normal dance you do to get the environment setup for Django to work
import sys
import site
import os
vepath = '/home/wdo/sites/my.bahai.us/lib/python2.6/site-packages'
prev_sys_path = list(sys.path)

site.addsitedir(vepath)
sys.path.append('/home/wdo/sites/my.bahai.us/checkouts/mybahai')
sys.path.append('/home/wdo/sites/my.bahai.us/checkouts')

new_sys_path = [p for p in sys.path if p not in prev_sys_path]
for item in new_sys_path:
    sys.path.remove(item)
sys.path[:0] = new_sys_path

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mybahai.settings'

from psycopg2 import IntegrityError

from django.contrib.gis.utils import mapping, LayerMapping, add_postgis_srs
from mybahai.census.models import CensusBlock
from django.conf import settings

if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    sys.exit('You must provide the state name of the block data you want to load an argument to this script.')

STATE = sys.argv[1]

try:
    add_postgis_srs(900913)
except IntegrityError:
    print &quot;The Google Spherical Mercator projection, or a projection with srid 900913, already exists, skipping insert&quot;

census_shp = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_PATH,'census/scripts/data/tl_2010_' + STATE + '_tabblock10/tl_2010_' + STATE + '_tabblock10.shp')

census_mapping = {
    'state_fips': 'STATEFP10',
    'county_fips': 'COUNTYFP10',
    'tract_code': 'TRACTCE10',
    'block_number': 'BLOCKCE10',
    'geo_id': 'GEOID10',
    'name': 'NAME10',
    'feat_code': 'MTFCC10',
    'land_area': 'ALAND10',
    'water_area': 'AWATER10',
    'internal_lat': 'INTPTLAT10',
    'internal_lon': 'INTPTLON10',
    'mpoly': 'MULTIPOLYGON',

}

census_layer = LayerMapping(CensusBlock,
                      census_shp,
                      census_mapping,
                      transform=False,
                      encoding='iso-8859-1')

census_layer.save(verbose=False, strict=True, progress=True)
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned above, this is something that can take an insane amount of time to complete. If you&#8217;re having trouble getting it to finish the whole job, the LayerMapping tool does support passing a <code>fid_range</code> keyword argument into the <code>.save()</code> method with a tuple containing the indexes of the first and last features you want to load. That gives you a way of resuming should something get frozen or die on you. On a test run, I was able to load all 450,000+ shapes for the state of Illinois into my Ubuntu VMs with relatively limited resources (512MB RAM for app server and 1024MB RAM for db server) on my Intel i5 MacBook Pro and it completed it. Eventually. It helps if you don&#8217;t watch.</p>
<p><strong>Fetching census data</strong><br />
This part is basically grabs the raw data from the Census Bureau and does some basic cleanup and generates the table headers (using <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/blob/master/dataprocessing/make_sf_data_2010_headers.py" title="Making 2010 census table headers" target="_blank">this script</a> from IRE) so that the next step is easier. I pretty much directly ripped this part off from <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/blob/master/dataprocessing/fetch_sf_data_2010.sh" title="Fetch 2010 data script" target="_blank">this script</a> from within the IRE project. Hey, they told me to <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/10/19/steal-this-code-presentation-to-hackshackers-opengovchicago/" title="Steal this code: News Apps Blog" target="_blank">steal it</a>. One thing I want to point out from within that file is the last line:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
in2csv -e &quot;latin-1&quot; -f fixed -s ${DATAPROCESSING_DIR}/census2010_geo_schema.csv ${STATE_NAME_ABBR}geo2010.sf1 &gt; ${STATE_NAME_ABBR}geo2010.csv
</pre>
<p>This leverages the ever useful <a href="https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit" title="CSVKit on Github" target="_blank">csvkit</a> to take the census2010_geo_schema.csv file and add it as a header to the data that comes with the census data about the actual geographic areas that are part of the census data file you downloaded in the first part of the script. This becomes kind of the lynchpin when we get to the part where we&#8217;re loading the census numbers data into Django models.  </p>
<p><strong>Make cross reference table</strong><br />
The Census Bureau provides the census data in what I consider to be relatively cryptic form. I suppose it&#8217;s all in the interest of making it portable and platform agnostic but for me it was somewhat of a headache to make heads or tails of what was going on there. Again, if it weren&#8217;t for the work put in on the IRE project, I would be nowhere.</p>
<p>The first part of the headache was trying to relate the geospatial data that we&#8217;ve already loaded to the census data that we&#8217;re about to load so that when you query a place, you know how many people live there. The way this was accomplished by the IRE project was by building sort of a throw away cross reference relation that both the GIS data and the census data have in common. Which is trickier than it sounds for reasons that are totally unknown to me (this seems like such a no-brainer&#8230;). Since MongoDB is a non-rel database, the process that the IRE project had to go through to make the relation involved making a key for both a geography object that a census object would have in common with it and then looking for it when you&#8217;re loading the census data up. My approach was to build a table that each geography would have a ForeignKey to and then looking up that geography using that relation when I loaded the census data. It has pretty much the same effect as the IRE approach only it&#8217;s relational rather than non-relational. Anyways, here&#8217;s the code I used to make the cross reference table:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import site
import os
import json

from csvkit.unicsv import UnicodeCSVReader

import config
import utils

... Normal Django environment setup goes here ...

from mybahai.census.models import CensusBlock, XRef

if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    sys.exit('You must provide the filename of a CSV as an argument to this script.')

FILENAME = sys.argv[1]

def make_xref(d):
    # Strip off unncessary attrs
    d.pop('CHARITER')
    d.pop('CIFSN')
    x, created = XRef.objects.get_or_create(fileid=d.pop('FILEID'), stusab=d.pop('STUSAB'), logrecno=d.pop('LOGRECNO'))
    return x

with open(FILENAME) as f:
    rows = UnicodeCSVReader(f)
    headers = rows.next()

    for row in rows:

        geography = {}
        row_dict = dict(zip(headers, row))

        if row_dict['SUMLEV'] not in config.SUMLEVS:
            continue

        # Ignore that is not for complete geographies
        if row_dict['GEOCOMP'] != config.GEOCOMP_COMPLETE:
            continue

        geography['sumlev'] = row_dict.pop('SUMLEV')
        geography['geoid'] = utils.GEOID_COMPUTERS[geography['sumlev']](row_dict)

        xref = make_xref(row_dict)
        block = CensusBlock.objects.get(geo_id=geography['geoid'])
        block.xref = xref
        block.save()
</pre>
<p>The crux of what&#8217;s going on here is that it&#8217;s taking the <code>[state abbrv]geo2010.csv</code> file that you created in step two, going through it row by row, creating a cross reference based upon part the <code>FILEID</code>, (which is basically the same for all of these since we&#8217;re just using the <a href="http://www2.census.gov/census_2010/04-Summary_File_1/" title="Census Data Summary File - raw data" target="_blank">census summary file</a>) the <code>STUSAB</code> (which is a state level identifier) and the <code>LOGRECNO</code> which is basically an index number for the entry in question. We&#8217;re then associating that with a particular census block based upon it&#8217;s <code>geoid</code>. That&#8217;s basically a concatenation of the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard" title="FIPS on Wikipedia" target="_blank">FIPS</a> codes of the areas that contain that block plus the block number. </p>
<p>One thing to note is that this script uses to external modules for some of it&#8217;s functionality <code>config</code> and <code>utils</code>. In my implementation, these are pretty much straight copies of <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/blob/master/dataprocessing/config.py" title="IRE dataprocessing config file" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/blob/master/dataprocessing/utils.py" title="IRE dataprocessing utils file" target="_blank">this</a>, respectively. I&#8217;m not using everything in there since some of it has to do with the MongoDB parts.</p>
<p>The part that makes a huge difference (and took me a fair bit of time to figure out) was to enable the block <code>SUMLEV</code> in the <code>config</code> file (this is what that <code>if row_dict['SUMLEV'] not in config.SUMLEVS</code> bit up there is all about). When you get the code from the IRE Github repo, it&#8217;s not turned on by default (which is understandable). To do that, you just need to add it to <code>SUMLEVS</code> list on line 16. For good measure, I also turned all the other ones off so I wouldn&#8217;t be loading data that I wasn&#8217;t going to be using.</p>
<p><strong>Actually loading the census counts</strong><br />
Now that we&#8217;ve made it possible to cross reference the census data with the geospatial data, let&#8217;s load it up. Just so you know what we&#8217;re working with, the SF1 (Summary File 1) data that we&#8217;re loading here is broken down into 300+ tables which are divided amongst the 47 files we downloaded in step to. You can see the extensive (and rather nitpicky) nature of what that looks like in the census.ire.org app (<a href="http://census.ire.org/data/1714000.html" title="Chicago census data" target="_blank">here&#8217;s Chicago</a>). Since I&#8217;m really only after 14 of these tables, I only built models to house 14 of them. Here&#8217;s a sample (putting the whole thing here would just be silly):</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
class P1(models.Model):
    geo_id = models.CharField(max_length=15, primary_key=True)
    p001001 = models.IntegerField()

    def __unicode_(self):
        return 'Total Population'

class P3(models.Model):
    geo_id = models.CharField(max_length=15, primary_key=True)
    p003001 = models.IntegerField()
    p003002 = models.IntegerField()
    p003003 = models.IntegerField()
    p003004 = models.IntegerField()
    p003005 = models.IntegerField()
    p003006 = models.IntegerField()
    p003007 = models.IntegerField()
    p003008 = models.IntegerField()

    def __unicode_(self):
        return 'Race %s' % self.geo_id

... etc ...
</pre>
<p>The script used to load data into these is, again, based heavily upon what was already in the IRE project, just with the MongoDB parts taken out and the PostGIS parts put in. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">

            x = XRef.objects.get(fileid=row_dict['FILEID'], stusab=row_dict['STUSAB'], logrecno=row_dict['LOGRECNO'])
        except XRef.DoesNotExist:

        geo_id = block.geo_id

        tables = {}

            t = utils.parse_table_from_key(k)
            if t:
                if t not in tables:
                    tables[t] = {}

                tables[t][k] = v
        for k, v in tables.items():
            if k not in GET_CENSUS_TABLE.keys():
                continue
            m = GET_CENSUS_TABLE[k]
            v = dict((k.lower(), v) for k,v in v.iteritems())
            v['geo_id'] = geo_id
            o = m(**v)
            o.save()
</pre>
<p>Quick rundown of the action here: we&#8217;re getting a census table file (one of the 47 created in step 2) as a command line argument, and associating each row with a <code>CensusBlock</code> object based upon that ever handy cross reference table that we created earlier. The <code>utils.parse_table_from_key(k)</code> part is, again, referencing a function from the <code>utils</code> module that uses a regex to parse which census table the row contains data from based upon the keys the pattern that is present in the row. Since I&#8217;m only interested in 14 of the tables, I&#8217;m only actually loading the data that is from those tables (hence the <code>if k not in GET_CENSUS_TABLE.keys():</code> part. After that, it&#8217;s just passing the geo_id and the table values into the Django model (which is looked up in the <code>GET_CENSUS_TABLE</code> dict) as keyword arguments. By the way, that&#8217;s my new favorite Python shortcut: <code>o = m(**v)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The final relation</strong><br />
The final step here is to relate my arbitrary geographies with the census blocks they contain. I chose to do this by creating a <code>ForeignKey</code> from the <code>CensusBlock</code> object to the <code>Locality</code> object which contains it. I&#8217;m still tweaking the actual queries that I&#8217;m going to run in this stage but, for the purposes of a proof of concept, it&#8217;s pretty solid. Here&#8217;s my script for this last stage:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#!/bin/env python

if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    sys.exit('You must provide a state abbreviation as an argument for this script.')

STATE = sys.argv[1]

locs = Locality.objects.filter(locality_state__state_abrv=STATE.upper())
for loc in locs:
    first_pass = CensusBlock.objects.filter(mpoly__coveredby=loc.mpoly)
    total_pop = 0
    for block in first_pass:
        block.locality = loc
        block.save()
        p1 = P1.objects.filter(geo_id=block.geo_id)
        total_pop += p1[0].p001001
    second_pass = CensusBlock.objects.filter(mpoly__overlaps=loc.mpoly)
    for block in second_pass:

    third_pass = CensusBlock.objects.filter(mpoly__bboverlaps=loc.mpoly)
    for block in third_pass:
        if not block.locality:
            block.locality = loc
            block.save()
            p1 = P1.objects.filter(geo_id=block.geo_id)
            total_pop += p1[0].p001001
    loc.locality_census_pop = total_pop
    loc.save()
    print 'Saved %s' % loc.locality_name
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m actually trying to catch the census blocks associated with a particular area in three, ever widening, passes because the first time I tried this, just using the <code>CensusBlock.objects.filter(mpoly__coveredby=loc.mpoly)</code> filter, I ended up with a bunch of <code>CensusBlock</code> objects that weren&#8217;t associated with any <code>Locality</code> objects. It&#8217;s still a little messy but, just to show you it can actually be done, here&#8217;s a screen shot showing a side-by-side comparison of what our Washington, D.C. <code>Locality</code> boundaries (which in this case correspond precisely with the actual boundaries of Washington, D.C.) look like next to all the census blocks that make it up:</p>

<p><strong>In all practicality&#8230;</strong><br />
Getting this far was relatively simple, given the amount of work that was already done for me by the wonderful IRE project. The next stage is going to be kind of where the rubber hits the road in terms of usability. I don&#8217;t really want to have to run through this process on every state more than once so I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll probably just serialize the parts I need and store them in an S3 bucket where I can grab it when I need it. But that&#8217;s a project for later&#8230; </p>

			<div class="post-author">written by: Eric</div>
							<div class="entry">
					<p>My introduction to Python, and Django in particular, was a week-long project to setup, from scratch, a basic, working GeoDjango project. Thanks to some really <a title="GeoDjango" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/" target="_blank">stellar documentation</a>, which has actually improved quite a bit since back in the day (like, a year and a half ago or whatever), I was able to do it. But, quite frankly, that was only the beginning. When I showed off my little application around the office, it ended up being a full fledged project, which I&#8217;m still tweaking to this day. This is an attempt to unravel some of what I&#8217;ve picked up during that time, especially given all of the recent developments in the web based mapping sphere. This is by no means a comprehensive overview, but rather just a guy sharing how he does what he does.</p>
<p><strong>Map theory</strong></p>
<p>Web based maps exist in a browser as layers. You&#8217;ve usually got a street map layer that you can get from someplace like Google or, in my case, <a title="Cloudmade" href="http://cloudmade.com" target="_blank">Cloudmade</a>. This is pretty crucial as it gives the whole thing context. Street map tiles are generally built by rasterizing <a title="Open Street Map" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> data with varying degrees of detail for different zoom levels (so, for instance, you don&#8217;t see the alley that goes behind your apartment building until you zoom all the way in). Those images are chopped up into little squares and stuck on a server somewhere. On top of the street maps is generally where you&#8217;ll put your data, either in the form of polygons or rasterized tiles (just like the street maps but maybe a bit more transparent so you can see the street maps). These layers get stitched together with a bit of intelligent client-side Javascript which, on the one side, grabs the street maps, and on the other side loads data from your application (either in the form of raw data or more tiles). I&#8217;ll get more into the particulars of how that works in a bit, I just wanted to set the stage a bit so the next few sections have a bit of context.</p>
<p>Instead of showing you a relatively complex (and not fully implemented) project, I&#8217;ll go ahead and demonstrate a few things by building a rather silly application using some freely available <a title="Download Census shapefiles" href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2010/main" target="_blank">census boundary data</a>. If you&#8217;d like to follow along, once I had the <a title="Install GeoDjango" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/install/" target="_blank">basic GeoDjango stack</a> up and running, I downloaded California county boundaries and California census place boundaries and put them into <a title="Demo Models Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/1324843" target="_blank">these models</a>. To make that simpler, I used <a title="Load Data script Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/1324841" target="_blank">this script</a> (based on the one from the <a title="GeoDjango Tutorial" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/" target="_blank">GeoDjango tutorial</a>). I&#8217;ve also placed all the code that I put together for this demo in a <a title="evz/demo on Github" href="https://github.com/evz/demo" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting some basic data on the map</strong></p>
<p>Within the context of the GeoDjango application we&#8217;re building, the interaction between the server and client, in it&#8217;s most basic form, can look something like this. First, the Django app&#8217;s urls.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

from california.views import *

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^counties/$', counties, name='counties'),
    url(r'^places/$', places, name='places'),
)
</pre>
<p>Next, the views:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from california.models import *

def counties(request):
    counties = County.objects.all()
    return render_to_response('basic-county.html', {'counties': counties}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))

def places(request):
    places = Place.objects.all()
    return render_to_response('basic-place.html', {'places': places}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
</pre>
<p>Now, the meaty parts: the client-side Javascript. As I mentioned above, this is where all the stitching happens. For this example, I&#8217;m going to use some built in Django template tags and the <a title="OpenLayers" href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a> Javascript API to get the shapes where I want them with a bit of metadata attached. The snippet below shows you the javascript code from the template that&#8217;s doing most of the work. It&#8217;s inheriting from a template that puts a <code>div</code> with the ID of &#8220;map&#8221; on the page and also loads all the necessary external Javascript libraries. The same sort of approach would work for either of the views detailed above.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var map, vector, wkt, features, options, geom;
var collect = [];
var f = [];
var src = new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:4326');
var dest = new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:900913');
window.onload = function(){
    options = {
       'projection' : new OpenLayers.Projection(&quot;EPSG:900913&quot;),
       'numZoomLevels' : 20,
       'displayProjection' : new OpenLayers.Projection(&quot;EPSG:4326&quot;),
       'units' : &quot;m&quot;,
       'maxResolution' : 156543.0339,
       'maxExtent' : new OpenLayers.Bounds(-20037508,-20037508,20037508,20037508)
    };
    map = new OpenLayers.Map('map', options);
    layer = new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM(&quot;OpenStreetMap (Mapnik)&quot;);
    map.addLayer(layer);
    map.setCenter(
        new OpenLayers.LonLat(-97, 38).transform(
            new OpenLayers.Projection(&quot;EPSG:4326&quot;),
            map.getProjectionObject()
        ),
    5
    );
    vector = new OpenLayers.Layer.Vector(&quot;Regions&quot;);
    wkt = new OpenLayers.Format.WKT();
    {% for county in counties %}
        features = wkt.read('{{ county.mpoly }}');
        geom = features.geometry.transform(src, dest);
        collect.push(geom);
        var feat = new OpenLayers.Feature.Vector(geom);
        f.push(feat);
    {% endfor %}
    vector.addFeatures(f);
    map.addLayer(vector);
};
</pre>
<p>If you ask me, that code is kinda clunky. It seems that OpenLayers has the most robust Javascript API allowing you to do everything from what I just demonstrated to allowing users to draw their one shapes on the map. Where this might be kinda fun and useful for some cases, I&#8217;ve never really needed it. What I needed was a client-side Javascript library that was going to be fast, load quickly, work with most browsers and as a bonus maybe even on mobile devices. What I found was <a title="Leaflet" href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Leaflet and a bit more complexity</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>So, wow, you can load some county shapes on a map. Big deal. My kid can do that. What we want is something that is more interactive, and will maybe even load stuff dynamically as a user requests it. Wouldn&#8217;t that be cool? Not only is this slightly easier to do with Leaflet (as opposed to OpenLayers), it&#8217;s also going to give us an opportunity to flex a few GeoJSON muscles.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s build a Django view:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
def complex_counties(request):
    counties = County.objects.all()
    bbox = json.dumps(counties.extent())
    if request.is_ajax():
        d = {}
        for county in counties.geojson():
            geojson = json.loads(county.geojson)
            properties = {'name': county.name_trans, 'bbox':county.mpoly.extent, 'center':county.mpoly.point_on_surface.coords}
            geojson['id'] = county.geo_id
            geojson['properties'] = properties
            d[county.geo_id] = geojson
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps(d), mimetype='application/json')
    else:
        return render_to_response('complex-county.html', { 'bbox': bbox }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
</pre>
<p>A couple things to point out before moving on to the client-side.  You&#8217;ll notice that there are two paths here: one for the initial request and one for loading the GeoJSON. This works by adding the bounding box into the context and returning that for use on the client side. On the client side, you load the street map tiles as usual but then the bounding box is used to zoom the map to fit in the browser widow. Once that loads, the client-side code fires a <code>$.getJSON</code> call which gets the GeoJSON from this same view. The handy thing about GeoDjango, is that it constructs that for you out of the box. Whenever you want to access that, you just append <code>.geojson()</code> to the end of your QuerySet and it&#8217;ll make that available to you for each object within that QuerySet.</p>
<p>The GeoJSON spec provides for a place to put information about the geometry called, predictably enough, &#8220;properties&#8221;. The GeoJSON that is produced by GeoDjango doesn&#8217;t include that but, since it&#8217;s pretty simple to just turn it into a Python dictionary by using the json module, you can add that in there manually and put whatever you want in there. The reasons for this become apparent when parsing this out on the client-side.</p>
<p>The other thing to point out before moving on to the client side is that you can also quickly access the bounding box of any QuerySet by using the .extent() method. The one screwy thing about that is that the points are reversed. So, it&#8217;s longitude, latitude instead of latitude, longitude (which is what Leaflet will want on the client-side). I chose to take care of that over there (instead of in the Python code) just because I find it to be a bit cleaner and easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the client-side code:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
    var geojson, map;
    $(document).ready(function(){
        var spin_opts = {
          lines: 12,
          length: 7,
          width: 4,
          radius: 10,
          color: '#fff',
          speed: 1,
          trail: 60,
          shadow: true
        };
        var target = document.getElementById('spinner');
        var spinner = new Spinner(spin_opts).spin(target);
        var streets = new L.TileLayer('http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/[My API key]/998/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png');
        var bb = {{ bbox }};
        var sw = new L.LatLng(bb[1], bb[0], true);
        var ne = new L.LatLng(bb[3], bb[2], true);
        var bbox = new L.LatLngBounds(sw,ne);
        map = new L.Map('map');
        map.addLayer(streets);
        map.fitBounds(bbox);
        $.getJSON('{% url complex-counties %}', function(data){
            spinner.stop();
            parse_map_data(data);
        });
    });
    function parse_map_data(data){
        $.each(data, function(key,val){
            geojson = new L.GeoJSON();
            geojson.on('featureparse', function(e){
                e.layer.on('click', function(e){
                    shape_click(this);
                }, e.properties);
            });
            geojson.addGeoJSON(val);
            map.addLayer(geojson);
        });
    }
    function shape_click(shape){
        var content = &quot;&lt;h3&gt;&quot; + shape['name'] + &quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;
        var popup = new L.Popup();
        var point = new L.LatLng(shape['center'][1],shape['center'][0]);
        popup.setLatLng(point);
        popup.setContent(content);
        var bb = shape['bbox'];
        var sw = new L.LatLng(bb[1], bb[0], true);
        var ne = new L.LatLng(bb[3], bb[2], true);
        var bbox = new L.LatLngBounds(sw,ne);
        map.fitBounds(bbox);
        map.openPopup(popup);
    }
</pre>
<p>Quick rundown on what&#8217;s join on there: when the DOM is ready, the base map gets loaded along with a little <a title="Spin.js" href="http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/" target="_blank">spinner</a> doo-hicky and a <code>$.getJSON</code> call is fired which grabs the GeoJSON from the view, parses it using the parse_map_data function which in turn adds a click event to each shape that, when fired, zooms the map to that object and pops up a little bubble with the County name in it.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s getting a bit more interesting. There&#8217;s a bit more interactivity and we&#8217;re giving the user some kind of information, however simple, about what they&#8217;re looking at. The one thing we&#8217;re not really doing here is styling the objects as they are coming across but that&#8217;s a pretty trivial thing to do by adding more intelligence into the <code>geojson.on('featureparse'...</code> part up there. Take a look <a title="Leaflet GeoJSON docs" href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#geojson" target="_blank">over here</a> for more info on how to get that going.</p>
<p>But, even though it&#8217;s working pretty well at this stage, there is one big thing that is wrong with this approach and that is performance. We&#8217;re loading a whole bunch of stuff into the DOM all at once and I know from personal and painful experience that there are certain browsers (*cough* IE *cough*) on the market that will be crushed, even by this relatively simple map. So, what to do? Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked.</p>
<p><strong>Flatter is better</strong></p>
<p>Ever since I identified the map obsession I seem to have in common with the <a title="Chicago Tribune NewsApps" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">News Applications</a> guys down at the Chicago Tribune, I&#8217;ve followed what they produce pretty closely. The thing that really got my attention was a series of <a title="Making maps: Chicago Tribune NewsApps blog" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/" target="_blank">blog posts</a> that they published in March of this year detailing how they put together a then recent series of maps and which were entirely as static resources from an S3 bucket. As I mentioned earlier, the scale that I was having to deal with in the applications I was putting together kept putting me in the awkward position of trying to explain why it was that IE couldn&#8217;t load 1200 objects into the DOM without folding. If I could pull off the approach that the Chicago Tribune guys were taking, this would not only mean that I could sidestep the whole browser issue but I might even get a pretty cheap hosting solution out of it.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t get everything that I wanted but I did get pretty close. What I came up with was sort of a hybrid solution using the tile layers that the TribApps guys talk about on their blog without losing the intelligence of the GeoDjango backend. </p>
<p><strong>TileStache</strong></p>
<p>The big caveat of taking a flatter approach to rendering maps is that there&#8217;s a lot of processing that you have to do up front. To render out tiles for every zoom level for the entire continental United States could take weeks. This is because each time you zoom in you increase the number of tiles you need by a factor of 4 so by the time you get up to zoom level 22 or whatever, you&#8217;re talking about billions of individual images that you&#8217;ll need. </p>
<p>This is where <a title="TileStache" href="http://tilestache.org/" target="_blank">TileStache</a> comes in very handy. What it does, in a nutshell, is very quickly renders the tiles on the fly and them caches them so that the next time a request comes in asking for them, they&#8217;re already prepared. How, you ask? Well, it&#8217;s pretty simple actually. But first we need to take a step back and look at how to prepare the type of file that TileStache needs for input.</p>
<p><strong>TileMill</strong></p>
<p>By far the best application for working with map tiles is <a title="TileMill" href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill</a> which is an open source tool by MapBox for taking geospatial data and turning it into pretty map tiles. For the purposes of this demo, I&#8217;m not going to get too deep into the more advanced features but I encourage you to take a look. There are some pretty slick possibilities there.</p>
<p>After you get it up and running and maybe kick the tires a bit to get familiar with what&#8217;s going on there, you can either point TileMill at the PostgreSQL database that you created for your GeoDjango project or you can just point it at the shapefiles that you used to load data into that database. I&#8217;m just gonna use the shapefiles because it&#8217;s a little quicker and cleaner. Before you do that, however, you need to prepare the shapefiles a bit so that TileMill will load them without a problem. This is how I did that:</p>

cd [directory where your shapefiles]
shapeindex *.shp
for i in *.shp
&gt; zip `basname $i .shp` `basename $i shp`*;
</pre>
<p>If you grabbed the <a title="evz/demo on Github" href="https://github.com/evz/demo" target="_blank">Github repo</a> at the beginning, I&#8217;ve already done that for those files so you can skip that part. If not, you&#8217;ll need to have the GDAL libraries installed on whichever machine you run that command on.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m not going to get too into the nuances of designing your tile layers. I&#8217;m just going to stick with something very basic to demonstrate the principles here. This is the stylesheet I used for TileMill:</p>
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#counties {
  polygon-opacity: 0;
  line-width: 2;
  line-color: #123456;
  line-opacity: 0.4;
  line-join: round;
}
</pre>
<p>Now comes the fun part getting the tiles to render in TileStache and getting them back on to our map.</p>
<p><strong>Setup TileStache</strong></p>
<p>One of the formats that TileStache can use to style up your tiles is called Mapnik XML which, handily enough, TileMill provides for any project you start. When you&#8217;re looking at your project, just click the little wrench icon to the right of the breadcrumb menu at the top and then click &#8220;Mapnik XML&#8221; near the bottom of that dialog. This will generate an XML file and save it onto your local file system. </p>
<p>Before we can put that into TileStache, there are a couple things you&#8217;ll need to know about setting up TileStache and making sure those XML files will work. First, for the purposes of this demo, I setup a separate VM that is running my tilestache instance. This, in a nutshell, is how I did that from a base Ubuntu 10.04 box (can&#8217;t remember why I chose that version but, hey):</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">
apt-get install python-software-properties
add-apt-repository ppa:developmentseed/mapbox
apt-get update
apt-get install libmapnik2-dev
apt-get install python-mapnik2
cd /home/tiles/
apt-get install python-virtualenv
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
cd tilestache/
pip install -r requirements.txt
apt-get install nginx
vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tiles # added a reverse proxy for the app to serve it to my host box
invoke-rc.d nginx restart
gunicorn &quot;TileStache:WSGITileServer('configs/demo.cfg')&quot;
</pre>
<p>The tricky part there is using the <a title="Development Seed" href="http://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank">Development Seed</a> PPA to get an already built Mapnik2. Ubuntu is still on a older version by default. You&#8217;ll need the newer version in order to get TileStache to be able to read the XML files that TileMill produces, since they use a newer spec. The requirements file that I included in the <a title="evz/demo on Github" href="https://github.com/evz/demo" target="_blank">Github repo</a> includes <a title="Gunicorn" href="http://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank">Gunicorn</a> to handle the WSGI stuff and the last line of that code above is actually how you get TileStache running under Gunicorn. </p>
<p>The three parts that TileStache needs to start cranking out files are the Mapnik XML that we got from TileMill, the actual data source (in this sample it&#8217;s just a shapefile) and a configuration file. This is the config file that I&#8217;m going to use for the counties layer:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
{
  &quot;cache&quot;:
  {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Disk&quot;,
    &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/home/tiles/stache&quot;,
    &quot;umask&quot;: &quot;0000&quot;,
    &quot;dirs&quot;: &quot;portable&quot;,
  },
  &quot;layers&quot;:
  {
    &quot;counties&quot;:
    {
        &quot;provider&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mapnik&quot;, &quot;mapfile&quot;: &quot;../styles/counties.xml&quot;},
        &quot;projection&quot;: &quot;spherical mercator&quot;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>For this example, I&#8217;m using the simple on disk caching but there are a bunch of other things you can do with that. Needless to say, <a title="TileStache docs" href="http://tilestache.org/doc/" target="_blank">read the docs</a>. The other thing you&#8217;ll see there is that you have to point it at your Mapnik XML file. But before this will work, we have to clean it up so that it&#8217;ll work. </p>
<p>The first thing is to get rid of the background color, if you set one in TileMill. It&#8217;s at the end of the first <code>Map</code> element in the file. The other thing to do is make sure that the XML file knows how to find your data source. There&#8217;s a <code>Parameter name="file"</code> tag in the XML that you&#8217;ll want to edit to point to where your shapefile is stored on the machine that is running TileStache. I&#8217;ve included a configuration file and a rendered version of the Mapnik XML in the tilestache folder within the Github repo so you should be pretty much ready to go for the next part.</p>
<p><strong>Putting tiles on the map</strong></p>
<p>After all that, Leaflet actually makes it pretty easy to put the tiles on the map:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
    $(document).ready(function(){
        var streets = new L.TileLayer('http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/[My API key]/998/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png');
        var counties = new L.TileLayer('http://tiles/counties/{z}/{x}/{y}.png');
        var places = new L.TileLayer('http://tiles/places/{z}/{x}/{y}.png');
        var bb = {{ bbox }};
        var sw = new L.LatLng(bb[1], bb[0], true);
        var ne = new L.LatLng(bb[3], bb[2], true);
        var bbox = new L.LatLngBounds(sw,ne);
        var map = new L.Map('map');
	    map.addLayer(streets);
	    map.addLayer(counties);
        map.addLayer(places);
        map.fitBounds(bbox);
    });
</pre>
<p>Predictably, the new tile layers are loaded as <code>L.TileLayer</code>. I also prepared another layer in TileMill for the census places and added that into the TileStache config file so that I can load that layer here as well.</p>
<p>This may seem like a step backwards but just bear with me. It&#8217;s gonna get interesting here in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Getting back the data and more interactivity</strong></p>
<p>Using the tile layers to draw the boundaries of the shapes has one huge advantage over using polygons: performance. All the browser really needs to know how to do is load a bunch of images which it does pretty well. But, since they are just images, we lose our interactivity. Just as a quick aside, there is a way to to add interactivity directly to the tile layers but since TileStache doesn&#8217;t have that built in (yet), I&#8217;m not gonna cover it here. Interested? <a href="http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/" title="MBTiles" target="_blank">Check it out (the interesting part is the part on the UTFGrid).</a>.</p>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s add the ability to search this sucker. The simplest way to accomplish this is by leveraging <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/" title="Google GeoCoder" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s GeoCoder API</a>. If you&#8217;ve never used it before, think of it as the brains behind the Google&#8217;s map search, because that&#8217;s what it is. Give it an address or a fragment of an address and it gives you back geographic info about it. Multiple matches? No problem, it gives you the opportunity to clarify. Here&#8217;s how I implemented that in a Django view for the example project:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
def map_search(request):
    counties = County.objects.all()
    places = Place.objects.all()
    bbox = json.dumps(counties.extent())
    if request.is_ajax():
        q = request.GET['search']
        goog = 'http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json'
        r = requests.get(goog, params={'address': q, 'sensor': 'false'});
        resp = json.loads(r.content)
        d = {'status': resp['status']}
        if resp['status'] != 'OK':
            d['message'] = 'Nothing was found matching your search. Please try again.'
        elif len(resp['results']) &gt; 1:
            clarify = []
            for res in resp['results']:
                clarify.append(res['formatted_address'])
            d['status'] = 'MULTIPLE_MATCHES'
            d['message'] = 'Did you mean one of these? Click the one you wanted to resubmit.'
            d['clarify'] = clarify
        else:
            bounds = resp['results'][0]['geometry']['viewport']
            bbox = (bounds['southwest']['lng'], bounds['southwest']['lat'], bounds['northeast']['lng'], bounds['northeast']['lat'])
            bbox_poly = Polygon.from_bbox(bbox)
            cnts = counties.filter(mpoly__bboverlaps=bbox_poly)
            plcs = places.filter(mpoly__bboverlaps=bbox_poly)
            c = []
            p = []
            for cnt in cnts.geojson():
                geojson = json.loads(cnt.geojson)
                geojson['properties'] = {
                    'name': cnt.name_trans,
                    'bbox': cnt.mpoly.extent,
                    'center':cnt.mpoly.point_on_surface.coords
                    }
                geojson['id'] = cnt.geo_id
                c.append(geojson)
            d['counties'] = c
            for plc in plcs.geojson():
                geojson = json.loads(plc.geojson)
                geojson['properties'] = {
                    'name': plc.name_trans,
                    'bbox': plc.mpoly.extent,
                    'center':plc.mpoly.point_on_surface.coords
                    }
                geojson['id'] = plc.geo_id
                p.append(geojson)
            d['places'] = p
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps(d), mimetype='application/json')
    else:
        return render_to_response('map-search.html', { 'bbox': bbox }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
</pre>
<p>So, quick rundown of what&#8217;s going on here: First time the view gets hit, it just renders the template and adds the bounding box info back into the context so that we can set the zoom for the map. The next time (and subsequent times) it&#8217;s hit with an Ajax request, it takes the <code>search</code> parameter from the querystring and sends it over to Google&#8217;s Geocoder using the excellent <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html" title="Python Requests" target="_blank">Python Requests</a> library. When it gets the response back, it parses it, finds the bounding box of the area in question (whether it&#8217;s a city or a zip code or whatever), then hits the GeoDjango database with this query <code>.filter(mpoly__bboverlaps=bbox_poly)</code> to find all the counties and places that fit within that bounding box (or, more precisely, overlap with that bounding box). There are a bunch of query filters that you can apply here that are pretty <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/gis/geoquerysets/#spatial-lookups" title="GeoDjango - Spatial Lookups" target="_blank">verbosely documented</a> in the GeoDjango documentation. Needless to say, I&#8217;m intentionally casting a pretty wide net. Once it has all the matching geometries, this view then packages it up on a JSON object and returns it back to the client.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening on the client side:</p>

        });
    }
    function search_array(arr, obj){
        return (arr.indexOf(obj) == -1);
    }
</pre>
<p>Another quick rundown: All the normal stuff at the top to initialize the map, including the new tile layers that we made. The next little bit is using a <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/form/" title="jQuery forms" target="_blank">jQuery forms plugin</a> to submit the search query from a form field on the template to the view and handle the response that comes back. When the response comes back from the view (which is the JSON object that I referenced earlier) it gets parsed by the <code>parse_results</code> function. If there is some need for clarity (basically if your search returns more than one hit), you get back a list of possibilities and by clicking on one, it resubmits the form and tries again. Once you&#8217;ve only got one possibility, you get back the list of counties and places that match your query and by clicking on one, the map zooms to that area and puts a little popup over it with the place or county name in it. </p>
<p>Still, besides a pretty decent performance boost, we&#8217;re not to much farther than we were before. Now&#8217;s the time to start bringing the data.</p>
<p><strong>Add some data to your map</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I&#8217;m going to add some census data to the little popups using <a href="http://census.ire.org/" title="Census data from IRE" target="_blank">an API</a> that was built by the <a href="http://www.ire.org/" title="Investigative Reporters and Editors" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters and Editors</a> organization in partnership with a bunch of other folks. Luckily for us, we can leverage it pretty easily on the client side. As a quick aside, there are tons of tools on the <a href="http://census.ire.org/" title="Census data from IRE" target="_blank">census.ire.org</a> site for analyzing and sharing census data. Check it out if you&#8217;re into that.</p>
<p>Diving right in, here is the client side code that I added to the last example to get the total population of each area to show up in the little bubble along with the name of the place or county:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var census_data = {};
$(document).ready(function(){
    //...(snip)...
});
function parse_results(resp){
    //...(skip a bit)...
    if (resp['status'] != 'OK'){
        //...(snip)...
    } else {
        //...(snip)...
        $.each(county_geo, function(key,val){
            fetch_data(val['id'], census);
            counties += '&lt;p id=&quot;' + val['id'] + '&quot; class=&quot;result county&quot;&gt;' + val['properties']['name'] + '&lt;/p&gt;';
        });
        $.each(place_geo, function(key,val){
            fetch_data(val['id'], census);
            places += '&lt;p id=&quot;' + val['id'] + '&quot; class=&quot;result place&quot;&gt;' + val['properties']['name'] + '&lt;/p&gt;';
        });
        // ...(snip)...
    }
}
function fetch_data(geoid, handler){
    var callback = 'geoid_' + geoid;
    var url = 'http://censusdata.ire.org/' + geoid.substr(0,2) + '/' + geoid + '.jsonp';
    $.ajax(url,{
        dataType: &quot;jsonp&quot;,
        jsonpCallback: callback,
        success: census
    })
}
function census(data){
    census_data[data['geoid']] = data;
}
function zoom_detail(id, cl){
    //...(snip)...
    $.each(geo, function(key, val){
        //...(snip)
        var content = '&lt;h3&gt;'+val['properties']['name']+'&lt;/h3&gt;';
        content += &quot;&lt;p&gt;The 2010 population of &quot;+ census_data[val['id']]['metadata']['NAME'] + &quot; was &quot; + census_data[val['id']]['data']['2010']['P1']['P001001'] + &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;
        //...(snip)...

    }
}
</pre>
<p>All that I&#8217;ve added here is a function that saves the census data about the search results into a global variable that is then used to populate the popup bubble when a user clicks to view the detail of a particular area. And, really, this is just scratching the surface of what&#8217;s available through <a href="http://census.ire.org" title="Census data from IRE" target="_blank">that census API</a>. If you dig a bit deeper into that site, you&#8217;ll see that every scrap of census data is available in the JSON response that you are getting. </p>
<p>Taking a step back, I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;re eyes are kind of getting wide and you&#8217;re starting to see the potential here. In this example, I just used the <code>geoid</code> to get census data but if you don&#8217;t have that and just have geospatial data, you can leverage something like the Chicago Tribune&#8217;s <a href="http://boundaries.tribapps.com/#api" title="Chicago Tribune Boundary Service API" target="_blank">Boundary Service API</a> to get those ids (and even the boundary data itself). </p>
<p><strong>Conclusions?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this post (and the accompanying presentation that I&#8217;m going to give tonight at the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=267220009989198" title="Chicago Djangonauts - November meeting" target="_blank">Chicago Djangonauts</a> meeting) is to just demonstrate some of the tools that are out there and really just to get you thinking about what&#8217;s possible. The samples here are by no means a working, production ready application but hopefully just something to get your mind going.</p>

					<p>One of the challenges I identified early one when <a title="OMG FREE HOSTING: An homage to Harper Reed" href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/22/omg-free-hosting-an-homage-to-harper-reed/" target="_blank">setting up this site</a> was that it was going to be a bit tricky to get some kind of search tool working for it. When I Googled it, I was pretty excited to find <a title="Tapir search" href="http://tapirgo.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a> but when I sat down yesterday to implement it, it was broke. And by broke, I mean it wasn&#8217;t returning any results and the developers weren&#8217;t responding to any attempts at communications. So, I figured, if they can parse my RSS feed and turn it into something that returns search results, so can I. What follows is how I managed to get that going.</p>
<p><strong>AppEngine, again</strong></p>
<p>It seems like recently I&#8217;ve found quite a few uses for AppEngine. And this is without even really having it on my radar before last week. Besides serving this site from it, a coworker and I put together a little email handler for a <a title="Wufoo" href="http://wufoo.com" target="_blank">Wufoo</a> form on AppEngine earlier this week. So, when my dream of making this site only rely on external web services for interactivity fell apart at some point yesterday, I guess it seemed like a natural fit.</p>
<p>Really, all that the search widget over there in the right sidebar does is do a jQuery <code>$.getJson</code> call to the AppEngine app which grabs my <a title="Static Eric RSS Feed" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/static-eric" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> from Feedburner, parses it, looks for the query string in the content of the feed, and then returns a JSONP reponse. Here&#8217;s what that looks like on the AppEngine side:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">

#!/usr/bin/env python
import logging
import json
import webapp2 as webapp
from feedparser import parse

class SearchSite(webapp.RequestHandler):
def get(self):
q = self.request.get('query', '')
cb = self.request.get('callback', '')
tree = parse('http://feeds.feedburner.com/static-eric')
d = {}
resp = []
for entry in tree['entries']:
    if q.lower() in entry['content'][0]['value'].lower():
        props = {}
        props['title'] = entry['title']
        props['updated'] = entry['updated']
        props['summary'] = entry['summary']
        props['link'] = entry['links'][0]['href']
        resp.append(props)
        d['status'] = 'ok'
    else:
        d['status'] = 'no_results'
    d['resp'] = resp
    d = json.dumps(d)
    d = &quot;%s(%s)&quot; % (cb,str(d))
    self.response.out.write(d)

app = webapp.WSGIApplication([('/', SearchSite)], debug=True)
</pre>
<p>Since the client is calling a Cross Domain resource here, the response needs to be a JSONP response in order for jQuery to be cool with it (hence wrapping the json in the callback there). The other really, really cool thing I found was <a title="Feedparser on Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/" target="_blank">Feedparser. </a>The project is very mature but, unfortunately, the docs were on a domain that was owned by <a title="Mark Pilgrim on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_%28software_developer%29" target="_blank">Mark Pilgrim</a> (he was a heavy contributor to the project, apparently) so when he performed his recent info-suicide, that domain went with him. They&#8217;re putting docs up onto PyPi soon (at least that&#8217;s what the chatter in their forums is saying)</p>
<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s pretty easy to use. Import the module, give it a URL (or a sting with XML in it) and whammo, you&#8217;ve got a Python dictionary with all the stuff from the feed in it. Since the docs are temporarily gone, I can&#8217;t really say what other types of feeds or XML formats it accepts but it worked for the one that I&#8217;m generating from WordPress.</p>
<p>One other thing about that code that you&#8217;ll notice is that instead of doing the normal <code>from google.appengine.ext import webapp</code> I&#8217;m doing <code>import webapp2 as webapp</code> and I&#8217;m also able to do <code>import json</code> even though AppEngine is still on Python 2.5. This is because in my app.yaml, I told it to use Python 2.7:</p>
<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate" title="">
application: static-eric-search
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: true

handlers:

- url: .*
  script: main.app
</pre>
<p>On the client-side, I&#8217;m just taking the response and sticking it over in a div underneath the search form:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">

(function($){
    $('#searchsubmit').live('click', function(){
        $('.result').remove();
        $.getJSON('http://static-eric-search.appspot.com/?query='+$(this).prev().val()+'&amp;callback=?', function(data){
            var info = '';
            if (data['status'] == 'ok'){
                $.each(data['resp'], function(key,val){
                    info += '&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;' + val['title'] + '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;';
                    info += '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated: ' + val['updated'] + '&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';
                    info += '&lt;div style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;' + val['summary'] + '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
                });
            } else {
                info += '&lt;div class&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Your search found nothing. Try again&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
            }
            $('#search-results').append(info);
        });
    });
    $('.result h4 a').live('click', function(){
    $(this).parent().parent().find('.result-summary').toggle('blind');
});
})(jQuery);
</pre>
<p>So, I guess that&#8217;s pretty much it. That&#8217;s how you get get search working on a static site. It would be really cool to see <a title="Tapir search" href="http://tapirgo.com/" target="_blank">these guys</a> get their act together but, I guess it was kinda fun to do it on my own as well.</p>

					<p>After attending <a title="Hacks/Hackers October Meetup" href="http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/events/36413602/?eventId=36413602&amp;action=detail" target="_blank">this meetup</a> last week, I was pretty excited to get going on hacking census data for <a title="2010 Census: Leveraging what’s already been done" href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/23/2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done/" target="_blank">my own purposes</a>. I had the day off on Thursday so I spent most of the day trying to get the <a title="census.ire.org" href="http://census.ire.org/" target="_blank">census.ire.org</a> source <a title="census.ire.org on github" href="https://github.com/ireapps/census" target="_blank">code</a> running in a local VM. Despite being one of those guys that&#8217;s pretty good at following directions, I did run into a few problems (but, then again, I&#8217;m not much of a sysadmin). In the spirit of maybe making someone&#8217;s life easier, here&#8217;s how I got the project going in a Ubuntu 11.04 <a title="Vagrant" href="http://vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">vagrant VM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>First, a minor divergence</strong></p>
<p>The docs over in the <a title="census.ire.org on github" href="https://github.com/ireapps/census" target="_blank">github repo</a> follow standard Python development practices by first setting up a virtualenv into which all the code libraries for the project get installed thereby making it easy to compartmentalize what you&#8217;re doing in one project from another. Try as I might, I was unable to make this work (I posted <a title="#137: GDAL python bindings not liking virtualenv" href="https://github.com/ireapps/census/issues/137" target="_blank">an issue</a> in the repo, for those interested). There&#8217;s probably an easy answer out there somewhere but I, for one, was unable to find it. Since I was already setting this up in it&#8217;s own VM, I figured that made it compartmentalized enough for me so I went ahead and installed everything globally just so I could get the project up and running. So, without further ado, here&#8217;s the short version of how I setup my VM</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">

</pre>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></p>
<p>For me, that&#8217;s more a strategy question that anything. I&#8217;ve <a title="2010 Census: Leveraging what’s already been done" href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/23/2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done/">written a bit</a> about my motivations and what I hope to get out of it. In the couple days since then, I think I&#8217;ve come up with a more specific approach which I&#8217;ll be writing about once I have it laid out end to end (and get a few particulars cleared up). So, uh, once again, stay tuned.</p>

					<p>Part of what I do at work is make maps. To me, the best maps are those that show you, at a glance, something interesting about what&#8217;s going on around you, and, if you&#8217;re curious, allow you to explore what&#8217;s going on in the rest of the world. I&#8217;ve been following what the <a title="News Apps Blog" href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/" target="_blank">TribApps</a> team has been doing with the 2010 census data as it has been coming out and after going to a recent <a title="Hacks/Hackers October Meetup" href="http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/events/36413602/?eventId=36413602&amp;action=detail" target="_blank">Hacks/Hackers Meetup</a> where <a title="Through the Wire" href="http://blog.germuska.com/" target="_blank">Joe Germuska</a> presented some of the APIs that they&#8217;ve been working on and I gotta say, I was inspired. Below are some preliminary steps and observations.</p>
<p><strong>Custom boundaries, normalized data</strong></p>
<p>During the day, I work for the <a title="Baha'is of the United States" href="http://www.bahai.us" target="_blank">Bahá&#8217;ís of the United States</a>. The administration of the affairs of the Bahá&#8217;ís across the country are organized based on geographic boundaries which we call, originally enough, Bahá&#8217;í Localities. The boundaries of these geographies sometimes match up with normal things like counties, townships or municipal boundaries but are more often that not combinations or subdivisions of those. The other complexity is that they combine together to form other types of administrative subdivisions which have nothing to do with any other existing shapes defined by people who have large warehouses full of geographers busily drawing lines on maps. The upshot of all this is that if you want to try to project something like census data onto these areas, it can get kinda tricky. Luckily, someone had the foresight to assign a <a title="Federal Information Processing Standard on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard" target="_blank">FIPS</a> code to each of these areas so at least approximations can be made.</p>
<p>Also luckily, someone (namely <a title="census.ire.org" href="http://census.ire.org/" target="_blank">these guys)</a> has already done a bunch of the dirty work when it comes to normalizing the data provided by the census as well as putting a <a title="census.ire.org - javascript api docs" href="http://census.ire.org/docs/javascript-library.html" target="_blank">JavaScript API</a> on it. For me, however, since I&#8217;m going to need to do a lot of custom combinations of that data, and to be quite honest I don&#8217;t really need <em>all</em> of it, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m probably going to need to pull down the data that I need at put it into the Django models that house the rest of our geospatial data. That way I can preprocess a lot of it and have it ready when it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary steps</strong></p>
<p>So far all I&#8217;ve done is setup the <a title="census.ire.org on github" href="https://github.com/ireapps/census" target="_blank">Django project</a> powering census.ire.org and poked around with the API a bit. There are a ton of scripts within the project which do all kinds of wonderful things to get going with the mountain of data within the census. Since I&#8217;m mainly interested in grabbing this data and comparing it to what I&#8217;ve already got established with my larger mapping project, the first step is to actually make the models. I&#8217;ll try to keep this blog up to date with any pitfalls I encounter or brilliant discoveries I make. So, uh, if you&#8217;ve read this far, stay tuned.</p>

							<div class="entry">
					<p>Back in January, I read <a title="OMG FREE HOSTING: How to use GAE to host static sites for free" href="http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/26/how-to-use-app-engine-to-host-static-sites-for-free/" target="_blank">this</a> and thought it was a pretty cool idea. For some reason, I just kinda filed it away and didn&#8217;t really think about it until sometime in the early morning hours of October 22 when I got the urge to write about <a title="2010 Census: Leveraging what’s already been done" href="http://www.static-eric.com/2011/10/23/2010-census-leveraging-whats-already-been-done/">this</a> but didn&#8217;t really have anywhere to do it. Add to that the fact that I my brain starts hurting when I start to see the long road of configuring and deploying a site, whatever the platform. I just wanted something that would kinda be there, look presentable out of the box, and not have anything to do with PHP. What I came up with looks a little like this:</p>
<p>1) WordPress stack running locally on a <a title="Vagrant" href="http://vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant VM</a> (OK, OK, so, there is a bit of PHP)</p>
<p>2) <a title="Really static - WordPress Plugin Directory" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/really-static/" target="_blank">Really Static</a> WordPress plugin to render content as flat HTML</p>
<p>3) A bit of symlink magic to get all the necessary static files from the theme and the flat HTML files into one directory</p>
<p>4) A <a title="Eric on github" href="https://github.com/evz/static-eric" target="_blank">Github repo</a> where I push all the junk from above and a post-receive hook to sync it with AppEngine</p>
<p>5) <a title="DryDrop: Update AppEngine site by pushing to Github" href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">DryDrop</a> to setup the Google AppEngine project</p>
<p>In the end, it was pretty simple. Probably because I insist on only skimming the directions when setting these things up, I did run into a few pitfalls which I&#8217;ll share here.</p>
<p><strong>AppEngine and DryDrop setup</strong></p>
<p>When you actually get into it, AppEngine is pretty nifty. Breaking into it by trying to use it for something that it wasn&#8217;t really meant to do is not something I recommend unless you&#8217;re smarter than me (<a title="Zen of Python" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank">or Dutch,</a> apparently). It&#8217;s kinda like watching a movie from the other side of the screen, or something. After downloading DryDrop, it took me quite a while to figure out that it expected you to have the AppEngine SDK setup in the way that it gets setup when you install it on OS X. DryDrop looks for the SDK files in /usr/local and if you&#8217;re trying to make this work on something like Ubuntu, you either need to take that into account, or just get a Mac. Once you get over that, DryDrop works like a charm. Oh, and, it seems that if you want to use a custom domain with your AppEngine account, you&#8217;ve got to set it up on Google Apps, which is also free, but it&#8217;s yet another hassle.</p>
<p>The other big, big thing that I ran into was the way that AppEngine is very literal when it comes to static content. The way that the Really Static plugin spits out content is the way that you&#8217;d expect it to if you were going to be hosting it on a box using Apache or something. So, to fake the pretty URLs, it makes a folder with an index.html file inside (which something like Apache would use by default when serving that URL). AppEngine is not Apache. What I finally came up with was to put this into the DryDrop site.yaml (which is kind of a slimmed down version of the normal app.yaml that AppEngine normally uses).</p>

static_dir: '/'</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda hacky, but it works. It basically uses the regexes to find the appropriate index.html files so that I can keep my pretty URLs.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong></p>
<p>I struggle with Apache. I&#8217;m allergic to PHP. But my fear/loathing of fiddling with UI stuff for my own personal outweighs that so I went and grabbed <a title="XAMPP" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> and segregated my WordPress installation onto it&#8217;s own little VM. That way if I get really pissed off and just can&#8217;t take it anymore, I can do</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; title: ; notranslate" title="">vagrant destroy</pre>
<p>and then it will know who&#8217;s boss. I tried a bunch of different ways of getting flat HTML out of WordPress but the Really Static plugin was by far the best. It&#8217;s one of those things that just kinda works. For those of you out there that are looking to make WordPress really, really fast by static-ifying it, this plugin not only creates the flat files for you, but will change the links to use a different domain and upload them to a remote server all when ever the database is changed. So, uh, I&#8217;m not sure why anyone would put up with hosting a WordPress site anymore. Oh, there is that one thing:</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>This is the one thing I have yet to figure out. I&#8217;m looking at using <a title="Tapir search" href="http://tapirgo.com/" target="_blank">Tapir</a>, but that involves building an RSS feed which is possible for a flat site but I&#8217;ll need to figure out a way to put this into my workflow so that it isn&#8217;t a pain in the ass. In the meantime, I&#8217;m not too worried about it cause there&#8217;s only like 2 posts and a page. So, you&#8217;re on your own there.</p>
<p>I suppose this is just the beginning. I&#8217;m hoping this is a sustainable solution and Google doesn&#8217;t catch on and start charging me cause it&#8217;s pretty slick.</p>
